      <h2>Specification of terms</h2>
      <p>
        In general, the terms &mdash; i.e., the properties and classes &mdash; used in the VCDM are formally specified in
        Recommendation Track documents published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">W3C Verifiable Credentials
          Working Group</a> or, for some deprecated or reserved terms, in Reports published by the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/credentials">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>. In each case of such external
        definition, the term's description in this document contains a link to the relevant specification. Additionally, the
        `rdfs:definedBy` property in the RDFS representation(s) refers to the formal specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, a local explanation is necessary to complement, or to replace, the definition found in an external
        specification. For instance, this is so when the term is needed to provide a consistent structure to the RDFS
        vocabulary, such as when the term defines a common supertype for class instances that are used as objects of
        specific properties, or when <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-concepts/#section-rdf-graph">RDF Graphs</a> are
        involved. For such cases, the extra definition is included in the current document (and the `rdfs:comment` property
        is used to include them in the RDFS representations).

      <h2>Diagram description</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Overview diagram of the vocabulary (without the reserved and deprecated items, error codes, and `xsd` datatypes).</summary>
        <p>
          The diagram uses boxes, ellipses, and connecting lines with different "styles" 
          (border color, end marker, line type) to differentiate their semantic meaning:
          "Property", "Class", and "Datatype" are identified by the shape of the 
          graph node (e.g., an ellipse signifies a "Class"); "Superclass", "Domain Of", "Range",
          "Type", and "Contains" relationships are identified by the style of the connecting line.
          These style names are used in the explanation text that follows, below.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diagram is roughly divided into three sections — lower left, lower right, and upper.
          To make this description easier to understand, these sections will be respectively referred to
          as the "Proof", "Verification Method", and "Verification Relationship" sections.
          Shapes in the three sections are connected by lines of different styles; additionally, one box,
          labeled as "multibase" and shaped as "Datatype", bridges the two lower sections 
          ("Proof" and "Verification Method").
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of these sections has an ellipse at the top, labeled as "Proof", "VerificationMethod", 
          and "VerificationRelationship", respectively. Additionally, the Verification Method section also
          includes an additional ellipse, labeled as "ControllerDocument", side-by-side with the ellipse
          labeled as "VerificationMethod".
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Proof Section</h3>
          <p>
            The left side of the section contains another ellipse, 
            labeled as "ProofGraph", and connected with a line
            styled as "Contains" to the "Proof" ellipse. 
            A separate box, styled as "Property" and labeled as "proof", is connected
            with a line styled as "Range" to the "ProofGraph" ellipse.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two more ellipses in this section, 
            labeled as "Ed25519Signature2020" and "DataIntegrityProof", and
            each connected to the "Proof" ellipse with lines styled as "Superclass". 
            The "DataIntegrityProof" ellipse is also connected to a box, styled as "Property" and labeled as 
            "cryptosuite", with a line styled as "Domain Of". 
            The "cryptosuite" Property box is connected to a shape, styled as "Datatype" and labeled as "cryptosuiteString", 
            with a line styled as "Range".
          </p>
          <p>
            The right side of the section contains a column of labeled boxes, all styled as "Property".
            The labels, from top to bottom, are "previousProof", "domain", "challenge", "nonce", "created", and "proofValue". 
            The "Proof" ellipse is connected to all of these boxes with lines styled as "Domain Of". 
            The "previousProof" box is also connected to the "Proof" ellipse, with a line styled as "Range". 
            The "proofValue" box is connected to a shape, styled as "Datatype" and labeled as "multibase", with a line styled as "Range".
            Finally, the same "multibase" "Datatype" shape is connected to another box, styled as "Property" and labeled as "digestMultibase", with a line styled as "Range".
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Verification Method Section</h3>

          <p>
            The left side of this section contains a column of three labeled boxes, all styled as "Property". 
            The labels, from top to bottom, are "controller", "expires", and "revoked".
            Each of these is connected to the "VerificationMethod" ellipse, with a line styled as "Domain Of".
            The "controller" "Property" box is also connected to the "ControllerDocument" ellipse, while
            the "expires" "Property" box is also connected to the "Proof" ellipse (in the Proof section);
            both these extra connections are also with a line styled as "Domain Of".
          </p>

          <p>
            There is also a distinct box, styled as "Property" and labeled as "verificationMethod". 
            This "verificationMethod" box is connected to the "VerificationMethod" 
            ellipse, with a connecting line styled as "Range".
          </p>

          <p>
            The middle of this section contains three more ellipses, labeled as "Multikey, "Ed25519VerificationKey2020", 
            and "JsonWebKey".
            Each of these is connected to the "VerificationMethod" ellipse, with a line styled as "Superclass".
          </p>

          <p>
            Two boxes, styled as "Property" and labeled as "secretKeyMultibase" and "publicKeyMultibase", 
            are connected to the ellipse labeled as "Multikey" with a line styled as "Domain Of".
            Each of these boxes is also connected to the "multibase" "Datatype" shape in the Proof section, 
            with lines styled as "Range".
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, two boxes, styled as "Property" and labeled as "secretKeyJwk" 
            and "publicKeyJwk", are connected to the "JsonWebKey" ellipse,
            with a line styled as "Domain Of". 
            Both boxes are also connected to a shape, styled as "Datatype" and labeled as "rdf:JSON", with
            lines styled as "Range".
          </p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Verification Relationship Section</h3>
          <p>
            The left side of the section contains a single box, styled as "Property"
            and labeled as "proofPurpose". 
            This box is connected to the "VerificationRelationship" ellipse,
            with a line styled as "Range". 
            It is also connected to the "Proof" ellipse in the Proof section,
            with a line styled as "Domain Of".
          </p>

          <p>
            The right side of the section contains a column of labeled boxes,
            all styled as "Property". 
            The labels, from top to bottom, are "verificationMethod", "authentication", "assertionMethod", "capabilityDelegation", "capabilityInvocation", and "keyAgreement".
            Each of these boxes is connected to the "VerificationMethod" ellipse in the Verification Method section,
            with a line styled as "Range". 
            Finally, each of these boxes is also connected to the "VerificationRelationship" ellipse,
            with a line styled as "Type".
